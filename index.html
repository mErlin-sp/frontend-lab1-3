<p>Lviv (Ukrainian: &#1051;&#1100;&#1074;&#1110;&#1074;) is the largest city in western Ukraine, and the seventh-largest
    in Ukraine, with a population of 717,510 (2021 est.). It serves as the administrative centre of Lviv Oblast and
    Lviv Raion, and is one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine. It was named in honour of Leo, the eldest son of
    Daniel, King of Ruthenia.<br><br>
    Lviv emerged as the centre of the historical regions of Red Ruthenia and Galicia in the 14th century, superseding
    Halych, Che&#322;m, Belz and Przemy&#347;l. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia&ndash;Volhynia from 1272
    to 1349, when it was conquered by King Casimir III the Great of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of
    the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, the city became
    the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the
    West Ukrainian People's Republic. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the Lw&oacute;w Voivodeship in the
    Second Polish Republic. After the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Lviv became part of the Soviet
    Union.<br><br>
    The once large Jewish community was sharply reduced in number by the Nazis during the Holocaust. For decades there
    was no working synagogue in the city after the final one was closed by the Soviets. The once predominant Polish
    population was for the greatest part sent to Poland in the context of a population exchange between Poland and
    Soviet Ukraine in 1944&ndash;46.<br><br>
    The historical heart of the city, with its cobblestone streets and architectural assortment of Renaissance, Baroque,
    Neo-classicism and Art Nouveau, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. Due to
    its Mediterranean aura, many Soviet movies set in places like Venice or Rome were actually shot in Lviv. In 1991,
    Lviv became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.<br><br>
    The city has many industries and institutions of higher education such as Lviv University and Lviv Polytechnic. Lviv
    is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the Lviv Theatre of Opera and
    Ballet. The historic city centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.<br><br>
